kernel-clustering
=================

[**KeLP**][kelp-site] is the Kernel-based Learning Platform developed in the [Semantic Analytics Group][sag-site] of
the [University of Roma Tor Vergata][uniroma2-site].

This is the kernel-clustering module of KeLP. It contains clustering algorithms. The following algorithms are currently implemented:

* _KernelBasedKMeansEngine_: it is the implemetation of the clustering algorithm described in (Kulis '09). It is basically a kernel-based extention of the standard k-mean clustering algorithm.
